            <img src="images/utah.jpg" alt="utah">
        <p>Utah is known for its natural beauty, including red rock canyons, alpine peaks, deserts, and pine forests. It's located at the intersection of the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, and the Colorado Plateau. Utah is home to many animals, including Rocky Mountain elk, desert bighorn sheep, mountain lions, white-tailed jackrabbits, and more. Utah's state tree is the quaking aspen, and its state flower is the sego lily. Other common plants include Utah juniper, canyon maple, pinyon pines, and Joshua trees. Brigham Young is considered one of the leading colonizers of all time for his role in establishing some 360 communities in Utah. Utah is bordered by Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada. The state's capital is Salt Lake City.</p>
