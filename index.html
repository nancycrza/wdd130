            <p>I am a student at BYU-Idaho, and I live in Utah where I can see the mountains and temples around me. It's awesome to have classmates from all over the world. I'm thankful for the instructors I have; they are amazing. They have helped me gain more confidence through their love and support. Brother Swallow is one of those young instructors who definitely makes a difference. I want to thank him for his support and sincere interest. Thanks, Brother Swallow, for being caring and a disciple of our Savior.</p>

            <p>Utah is known for its natural beauty, including red rock canyons, alpine peaks, deserts, and pine forests. It's located at the intersection of the Rocky Mountains, the Great Basin, and the Colorado Plateau. Utah is home to many animals, including Rocky Mountain elk, desert bighorn sheep, mountain lions, white-tailed jackrabbits, and more. Utah's state tree is the quaking aspen, and its state flower is the sego lily. Other common plants include Utah juniper, canyon maple, pinyon pines, and Joshua trees. Brigham Young is considered one of the leading colonizers of all time for his role in establishing some 360 communities in Utah. Utah is bordered by Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada. The state's capital is Salt Lake City.</p>
